### Hi there ğŸ‘‹



<!--
**moejolloy/moejolloy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app which, in the event of a bidding system being implemented into T20 cricket matches in place of a coin toss, will give a cricket captain an idea of what to bid for, and an estimate for the number of runs to bid. Niche. More info [here:] (https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-replacing-the-toss-with-an-auction-is-the-fair-thing-to-do-1277744) 

It involves scraping, parsing, modelling and manipulating thousands of pieces of match data, and I will eventually get one of my front-end friends to help me make it look nice and be interactable, promise.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning skills which I think will help me get great foundations - namely bash/command shell skills, and data manipulation/modelling techniques.



- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
